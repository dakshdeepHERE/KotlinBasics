# OOPs

Kotlin is primarily `Obeject oriented` but it is also `Procedural` and `Functional`.

### You must have thought why OOP is so popular?

The answer is very simple becasue OOP's ability to translate real world problems into code is arguably the biggest factor in its success. OOP has high modularity, which makes code easier to understand, makes it reusable, adds layers of abstraction and allows for code blocks to be moved between projects.
