## Difference between a class and function

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and returns a result. It is a standalone piece of code that can be called and used in a program. A class, on the other hand, is a template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of the objects that will be created from it. An object is an instance of a class, and it can be used to access and manipulate the properties and behaviors defined in the class.

So, the main difference between a function and a class is that a function is a block of code that performs a specific task, while a class is a template for creating objects that have their own properties and behaviors.
