# Abstract vs Interface

| Interface                                     | Abstract                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| All methods are open                          | Methods can be open or non open                      |
| A class can implement one or more interface   | Methods and members can be abstract or non abstract  |
 | A class can implement one or more interface   | A class can only be inherited  from one class        |

## Concluding thoughts

We now know more about abstract classes. We considered their restrictions and explored how abstract classes are used in practice â€“ such as in the above files of abstract and interface files.
