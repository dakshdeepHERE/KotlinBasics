Question :- 

## Scenario:-

Imagine you have secured a job with a game development company. Your first assignment is to create a small piece of code to hold the player data for one of their games. The requirements of your program are:

- Store and display the player’s full name
- Store, manipulate and display the player’s score data 
- Store and display a personal best score (players get a score for each level played) 
- Display the winning player’s name and their total score and their best level score

When all your code is completed you will have a final console output that simulates an end-of-game score. You will have two lines each with text and a player score.  (This is just an example of the output, you will input level sores later to produce a final result).

```aidl
The winner is Nicola Tesla with a Score of 158 
Personel Best score is = 90
```
The solution for this question will be on next Kotlin file.
