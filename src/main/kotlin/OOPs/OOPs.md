## OOPS

Programming languages are built upon certain models to ensure that code behaves predictably. You are already aware that Kotlin treats everything as an object, which is why Kotlin lends itself so well to the object-oriented programming paradigm. Kotlin primarily follows what is known as the object-oriented paradigm or model. As you'll soon discover object-oriented programming or OOP relies heavily on simplicity and reusability to improve workflow. By the end of this video, you'll be familiar with the object-oriented programming paradigm. This knowledge will reinforce the knowledge you have already gained about Kotlin. You'll also be able to identify the four main concepts that define object-oriented programming. Programming paradigms are a strategy for reducing code complexity and determining the flow of execution. There are several different paradigms such as declartive, procedural, object-oriented, function, logic, event-driven, flow-driven and more. These paradigms are not mutually exclusive. So programs and programming languages can opt for multiple paradigms. For example, Kotlin is primarily object-oriented, but it is also procedural and functional. In simple terms, a paradigm can be defined as a style of writing a program. OOP is one of the most widely used paradigms today due to the growing popularity of languages that use it, such as Java, Kotlin, C++ and more. But the OOP's ability to translate real world problems into code is arguably the biggest factor in its success. OOP has high modularity, which makes code easier to understand, makes it reusable, adds layers of abstraction and allows for code blocks to be moved between projects. To help you better understand OOP, I'll first clarify some of its key components which are classes, objects and methods. You are already familiar with these concepts and have had some practical experience of using them. A class is a logical code block that contains attributes and behavior. In Kotlin, a class is defined with the class keyword. The attributes can be variables and the behavior can be functions inside of it. You can create instances from these classes which are called objects. In other words, a class provides a blueprint for creating an object. In more practical terms, let's say you want to record the attributes of employees at the little lemon restaurant such as their position and employment status. You could create a class called Employee and conveniently bundle those attributes in one place. Next, let's discuss objects. As mentioned an object is an instance of a class and you can create any number of them. The state of an object is comprised of its attributes and behavior and each one has a unique identifier to distinguish it from other instances. The attributes and behavior of the class are what define the state of the object. For example, you can create the object emp1 by calling the Employee(). Once called, you can define the position and employment status attributes as Shift Lead and Full-Time respectively. In code, this would be written as emp1 = Employee followed by ("Shift Lead", "FT"). This is a case of instantiation or creating an instance of a class. Finally, there are methods which are functions defined inside a class that determine the behavior of an object instance. Now that you have refreshed your memory on the building blocks of objects, let's dig into some of the main concepts of OOP. The first one is inheritance, which is the creation of a new class by deriving from an existing one. The original is called the parent or super class, while any derivatives are referred to as the subclass or child class. The next concept is called polymorphism. It's a word that means having many forms. In the context of Kotlin, polymorphism means that a single function or object can act differently depending on the object or function that uses it. For example, the built in + operator works differently for different data types. In the case of integer data types, the built in + operator performs additional operations such as 3 + 5 = 8. On the other hand, in the case of string data types, the built in + operator performs a concatenation or combining two strings together. This ability of modifying functionality is called polymorphism. The third concept is encapsulation. Broadly, this means that Kotlin combine methods and variables from direct access by wrapping them within a single unit of scope, such as a class. Encapsulation helps prevent unwanted modifications in effect, reducing the occurrence of errors and output. And finally, there is the concept of abstraction. This refers to the ability to hide implementation details to make data safer and more secure. There are other important concepts in OOP such as method overloading, method overriding, constructors and more, which you'll learn about in more detail later. In this video, you became familiar with OOP paradigm and the four concepts that support it, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and abstraction. The following lessons will concentrate on the practical implementation of these concepts. See you next time.
