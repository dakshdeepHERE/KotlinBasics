### Open Class and Methods

## Parent - Child relationship 

When one class inherits from another, it takes all the previous classâ€™s behavior (its methods and properties). It also becomes its subclass, which means that it can be used wherever its parent is expected. So, in the example below, Dog is a subclass of Mammal, or Mammal is a superclass of Dog. It is also called a parent-child relationship, so Dog is a child of Mammal, and Mammal is a parent of Dog.

```kotlin
open class Animal{
    fun feedTheAnimal(){}
}
class Dog:Animal{
    fun Fetch_the_Stick(){}
}
fun feed(mammal:Animal){
    fun Feed_the_Childer(){}
}

fun main(){
    val dog = Dog()
    dog.feedTheAnimal()
    dog.Fetch_the_Stick()
    feed(dog)
}
```
