### Open Class and Methods

## Parent - Child relationship 

When one class inherits from another, it takes all the previous classâ€™s behavior (its methods and properties). It also becomes its subclass, which means that it can be used wherever its parent is expected. So, in the example below, Dog is a subclass of Mammal, or Mammal is a superclass of Dog. It is also called a parent-child relationship, so Dog is a child of Mammal, and Mammal is a parent of Dog.
